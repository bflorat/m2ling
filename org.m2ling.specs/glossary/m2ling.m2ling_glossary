  <contents name="Parameter" internal_definition="A parameter is a mutable attribute of a system. A parameter owns a parameter definition and a value. A parameter can be replaced by its value during the build process, during deployment or at runtime. It may be categorized in many ways including : platform dependent or platform-independent, Functional or technical oriented, Integration-oriented (url a contributor system for ie) or performance oriented (number of threads in a pool for ie)" comment=""/>
  <contents name="ParameterDefinition" internal_definition="A parameter definition contains a comprehensive set of meta-data applying to this parameter like a default value, a set of rules, labels etc. A parameter definition should contain enough information to make the rule and the possible values clear."/>
  <contents name="ViewPoint" internal_definition="ViewPoints follow ISO 14010 standard. A viewpoint is &quot;a work product establishing the conventions for the construction, interpretation and use of architecture views to frame specific system concerns&quot;" user_definition="A viewpoint groups together all rules and workflows dealing with an aspect of an enterprise information system. Example : the applicative architects viewpoint deals mostly with applications and modules whether the operational architects viewpoint deals with infrastrcuture concepts. Views conforms with exactly one viewpoint." comment=""/>
  <contents name="View" internal_definition="Views follow ISO 14010 standard. A view is &quot;a form of abstraction achieved using a selected set of architectural constructs and structuring rules, in order to focus on particular concerns within a system&quot;. In m2ling, contrary with most others EA solutions, views are more responsibility-oriented than aspect-oriented (example : more &quot;Operational Architecture&quot; views than &quot;Performance Architecture&quot; views). Views follow one single ViewPoint." user_definition="A view is the modelisation of a system using the rules defined in the corresponding viewpoint.  When a viewpoint is role-oriented (like Operation architecture), a view is project-oriented (infrastruture aspects of project BikesOnline for instance) " comment=""/>
