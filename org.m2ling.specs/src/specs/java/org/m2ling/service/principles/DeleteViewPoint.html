	<H1>Viewpoint deletion</H1>
	<p>Administrators or actors with adequate authorizations can delete
		existing viewpoints.</p>

	<p>An existing viewpoint can be dropped :
	<div class="example">
		Given an existing viewpoint <b concordion:set="#id">id_vp1</b><br />
		When a delete is done against it <span
			concordion:execute="#resu=deleteWithoutRefs(#id)" /><br /> Then a
		search for it should return <b concordion:assertEquals="#resu">null</b>
	</div>
	</p>
	<p>Trying to remove an unexisting viewpoint should fail
	<div class="example">
		Given an unexisting viewpoint <b concordion:set="#id">id_unknown</b><br />
		Trying to delete it <span
			concordion:execute="#resu=deleteWithoutRefs(#id)" /><br /> should <b
			concordion:assertEquals="#resu">FAIL with code TARGET_NOT_FOUND</b>
	</div>
	</p>
	<p>The viewpoint can't be dropped while one architecture item uses
		a type defined in it.
	<div class="example">
		Given a viewpoint <b>id_vp1</b><br /> And a
		component <b concordion:set="#id">id_vp1</b> whose type is
		defined in this viewpoint<br />An attempt to delete the viewpoint <span
			concordion:execute="#resu=deleteWithLocalComp(#id)" /> should <b
			concordion:assertEquals="#resu">FAIL with code VP_IN_USE</b>
	</div>
	</p>

	<p>The viewpoint can't be dropped while one of its component type
		is used as binding from an architecture item from another viewpoint.</p>
	<div class="example">
		Given an existing viewpoint <b concordion:set="#id">id_vp1</b><br />
		And a component <b>id_comp2</b> whose type
		is defined in another viewpoint but whose type is bound to a type of
		this viewpoint<br />An attempt to delete the viewpoint <span
			concordion:execute="#resu=deleteWithBinding(#id)" /> should <b
			concordion:assertEquals="#resu">FAIL with code VP_IN_USE</b>
	</div>
