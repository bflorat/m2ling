	<p>Administrators or actors with adequate authorizations can delete
		existing views.</p>

	<p class='rule'>An existing view can be dropped :
	<div class="example">
		Given an existing view <b concordion:set="#idView">id_v1</b><br /> When a
		delete is done against it <span
			concordion:execute="#resu=delete(#id)" /><br /> Then a
		search for it should return <b concordion:assertEquals="#resu">null</b>
	</div>

	<p class='rule'>#VI41 Trying to remove an unexisting view should
		fail
	<div class="example">
		Given an unexisting view <b concordion:set="#idView">id_unknown</b><br />
		Trying to delete it <span
			concordion:execute="#resu=delete(#id)" /><br /> should <b
			concordion:assertEquals="#resu">FAIL with code TARGET_NOT_FOUND</b>
	</div>
	</p>
	<p class='rule'>#VI42 The view can't be dropped while at least one
		of its components is used as binding for a component from another view
		(this view always has a viewpoint type different from the one of this
		view).
	<div class="example">
		Given a view <b concordion:set="#idView">id_vp1</b>
		That contains a component <b>id_comp_v1_comp3</b> used as bound component by the component <b>id_comp_v2_comp3</b><br /> 
		An attempt to delete the view <span

	<p class='rule'>#VI43 The view can't be dropped while at least one
		of its component instances is used as binding for a component instance
		from another view.
	<div class="example">
		Given a view <b concordion:set="#idView">id_vp1</b>
		That contains a component instance <b>id_comp_v1_comp3_ci1</b> used as bound instance by the component instance <b>id_comp_v1_comp3_ci1</b><br />
