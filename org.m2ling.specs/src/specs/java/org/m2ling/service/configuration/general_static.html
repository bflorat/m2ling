	<h1>Notes</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>A ~ParameterDefinition~ can be done at M1 or M2 level (M2
			only for reifiable components types)</li>
		<li>~Parameter~ value can be done at M0 level only (for reifiable
			concepts), including node groups.</li>
		<li>PARAM uniquely identified by project id + its name</li>
		<LI>If long description is unset, it is equal to short
			description Projects and environments</LI>
		<li>No configuration against links (for now). We consider that links
			behavior depends on each component edge configuration</li>
		<li>targetType can be used for M1 level configuration when set upon
			non-reifiable components to provide explicit target type of
			reifiable sub-components. If it is not set, we assume that target
			type is the first sub-level of reifiable components.</li>
		<li>It is possible to apply some parameter definitions against
			components even if none component type is reifiable, then
			m2configuration is used as a parameter catalog without value</li>
		<li>When applying a parameter definition against a non-reifiable
			component, a component node group of name mycomponent_targettype is
			created to provide value attachment. This group can't be dropped to
			endorse value unicity among nodes as expressed setting the definition
			on the top-level component. It is automaticaly removed when no more
			parameter definition is set. The node group is "dynamic", kind of
			subcomp* meaning : any new sub-component is automaticaly added to it.</li>
